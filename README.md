# churn_vs_complexity
Generate churn vs. complexity data and present them using plotly

This will certainly not work as you want.  It's disgusting and I might throw it away but it was interesting to try.

YOLO.

```
bundle
```

To generate the csvs, run the bin with ruby:

```
bundle exec ruby bin/churn_vs_complexity.rb ~/path/to/my/git/repo
```

To see the charts, run:

```
bundlex exec rackup
```
