* Add gemspec (churn, flog, parallel) for bin script
* Add shebang stuff for bin script
* Alter paths in bin script so you can run the bin script and generate the csv
  wherever you want
* Currently, you need to run the bin script and move the csv files to the www
  directory.  That's silly, the bin script should put it in the right place.
* The csv file names are hardcoded in the html, this should be changed.
